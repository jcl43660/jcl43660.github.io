     <h2> Introduction </h2> 
    <img src= "wcs%20intro.jpg" alt = "Social Dancing">
         <p> West Coast Swing is a partner dance that was developed in California and originated from Lindy Hop. It is a partner dance that is unique in that it is constantly evolving and incorporating new styles, and for this reason has been influenced by many other partner dances such as Houston Whip, Dallas Push, and even Zouk! </p>

     <h2> Music </h2> 
    
         <p> West Coast Swing can be danced to any song that has a 4/4 or 2/4 time signature. This means that it can be danced to almost any song in any genre! Popular genres include pop, contemporary, blues, and hip hop. For this reason, west coast swing has been able to evolve over time and remain popular with younger audiences, because it can easily adapt to more modern styles of music. There is also no limit to the range of beats per minute. </p>

     <h2> Competition </h2> 
    <img src= "wcs%20competition.jpg" alt ="Dancing Competition">
         <p>There are 6 divisions of competition in west coast swing, according to skill level. In order to advance to the next division, one must win a certain amount of points which are won during competitions (see the table). The most popular form of competition is called a “Jack and Jill” where one is assigned a random partner, and dances to random songs that are played. The dance is completely improvisational, and thus requires true partnership and musicality (see the link for an example).   </p>
